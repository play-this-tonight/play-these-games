### Ideas

If I do something like add the igdb id, it could automatically fetch and select a bunch of stuff. So you wouldn't have to filter it. And then you could basically just add your little blurb.

- Add IGDB integration (figure out how environment variables work)
- Allow people to blurb
- Blurbs about the list you're putting together
- Blurbs about the game
  - Honestly though, this could just be in the igdb api
- Blurbs about why it belongs in the list (Probably the most impactful part here)
- Create contribution instructions

### Components of a New Game

- New file with a unique name
- igdb id
- link to your favorite review
- Should we let them create a review that overrides IGDB? (yes, probs)

### Parts from IGDB API I want to pull in

- title
- publisher
- developer
- where to purchase
- link to their website if it exists
